- 👋 Hi, I’m @Straycatt89
- 👀 I’m interested in video game development and video games in general, no developing games does not destroy the magic of playing them!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c# and Unity development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unity programming and game design.
- 📫 How to reach me (to be determined later)
